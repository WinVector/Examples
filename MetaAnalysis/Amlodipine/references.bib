	abstract = { Synopsis With the focus on evidence-based practice in healthcare, a well-conducted systematic review that includes a meta-analysis where indicated represents a high level of evidence for treatment effectiveness. The purpose of this commentary is to assist clinicians in understanding meta-analysis as a statistical tool using both published articles and explanations of components of the technique. We describe what meta-analysis is, what heterogeneity is, and how it affects meta-analysis, effect size, the modeling techniques of meta-analysis, and strengths and weaknesses of meta-analysis. Common components like forest plot interpretation, software that may be used, special cases for meta-analysis, such as subgroup analysis, individual patient data, and meta-regression, and a discussion of criticisms, are included.

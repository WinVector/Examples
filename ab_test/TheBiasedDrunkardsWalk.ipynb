    "This note is a deep dive into the biased drunkard's walk, and its application in what I will define as \"first to win <code>w</code> tournaments.\" This is anticipation of reexamining [Wald's Sequential Analysis](https://win-vector.com/2015/12/10/sequential-analysis/) (a variation of A/B testing with a correct early stopping procedure!).\n",

In this note we will concentrate on a biased drunkard's walk where the probability of decreasing our state is <code>p</code> and the probability of increasing state is <code>1-p</code>. We are again working with absorbing Marko chains, and not the usual regular, ergodic, or \"time reversible\" Markov chains. \n",

Another way of saying is this is to observe that if `Z` won the tournament after `j` games, then `P` won `r` games, and `Z` won `r + w`. This trajectory has a matching trajectory <code>t<sub>P</sub> in S<sub>P</sub></code> defined by reversing all the moves. <code>t<sub>P</sub></code> has relative probability <code>p<sup>r</sup> (1-p)<sup>r+w</sup></code>. The ratio of these two quantities is <code>(p/(1-p))<sup>w</sup></code> independent of <code>r</code>.

So <code>T<sub>b,a</sub></code> represents the probability of seeing state <code>b</code> immediately after state <code>a</code> (called \"<code>a &rightarrow; b</code>\" transition).\n",
    "  * This implies <code>T v</code> is the vector of probabilities one step after <code>v</code>. This \"operator matrix on the left\" notation is consistent with linear algebra practice. Unfortunately Markov chain literature, uses a reverse convention; putting the operator on the right. Not checking which convention is being used is a great source of confusion and errors.\n",

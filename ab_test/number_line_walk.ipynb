    "# The Drunkard's Walk In Detail\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "I would like to spend some time on a simple random walk on the non-negative integers <code>0 ... k</code> called \"the drunkard's walk\"  A *lot* of intuition can be had by studying the this system. This note is a quicker way to derive some of the observations found in [\"A Slightly Unfair Game\"](https://win-vector.com/2023/10/30/a-slightly-unfair-game/).\n",
    "\n",
    "I have found this differs from many treatments of Markov chains in that we are analyzing an \"absorbing chain\" (instead of a \"regular\" or \"ergodic\" one, see Kemeny, Snell, *Finite Markov Chains*, 2nd Edition, 1976, Springer Verlag) and we are using bespoke recurrence arguments instead of the usual move to linear algebra.\n"

    "Pick an integer <code>k &gt; 0</code>. Then the states of our random process are the integers <code>0</code> through <code>k</code>. The integers <code>0</code> and <code>k</code> are both \"stop conditions\" called \"stop zero\" and \"stop non-zero\". For an integer <code>i</code> strictly larger than <code>0</code> and strictly less than <code>k</code>, our random process is: pick the next integer to be either <code>i-1</code> or <code>i+1</code> with equal probability. We stop the process when <code>i</code> is either <code>0</code> or <code>k</code>. This is called a \"random walk\" and is often known as \"the drunkard's walk\". Some variations have \"stay probabilities\", but we will not need these here.\n",
    "\n",
    "What isn't emphasized enough is: a lot can be quickly seen for this walk, without using complicated tools or arguments. In particular we can quickly show the following.\n",
    "\n",
    "  1) The probability of a walk started in state-</code>i</code> \"stopping non-zero\" (first reaching <code>k</code>, with no prior visits to <code>0</code>) is <code>i/k</code>.\n",
    "  2) The expected time of a walk started in state-</code>i</code> to hit either of the stopping conditions (reaching <code>0</code> or <code>k</code> for the first time) is <code>i * (k - i)</code>.\n"

    "I would like to spend some time on a simple random walk on the non-negative integers `0 ... k` called \"the drunkard's walk\"  A *lot* of intuition can be had by studying the this system. This note is a quicker way to derive some of the observations found in [\"A Slightly Unfair Game\"](https://win-vector.com/2023/10/30/a-slightly-unfair-game/).\n"

    "Pick an integer `k > 0`, the states of our random process are the integers `0` through `k`. The integers `0` and `k` are both \"stop conditions\" called \"stop zero\" and \"stop non-zero\". For an integer `i` strictly larger than `0` and strictly less than `k`, our random process pick the next integer to be either `i-1` or `i+1` with equal probability. This is called a \"random walk\" and is often known as \"the drunkard's walk\". Some variations have \"stay probabilities\", but we will not need these here.\n",
    "\n",
    "What isn't emphasized enough is: a lot can be quickly see for this walk, without using complicated tools or arguments. In particular the following can all be shown for this system.\n",
    "\n",
    "  1) The probability of a walk started in state-`i` \"stopping non-zero\" (first reaching `k`, with no prior visits to `0`) is `i/k`.\n",
    "  2) The expected time of a walk started in state-`i` to hit either of the stopping conditions (reaching `0` or `k` for the first time) is `i * (k - i)`.\n"

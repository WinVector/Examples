    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "I would like to spend some time on a simple random walk on the non-negative integers <code>0 ... k</code> called \"the drunkard's walk\"  A good amount of probabilistic intuition can be had by studying the this system. This note is a quick way to derive some of the observations used in [\"A Slightly Unfair Game\"](https://win-vector.com/2023/10/30/a-slightly-unfair-game/) and to set up some of the machinery used in Wald's \"Sequential Analysis\" (a relative of A/B testing).\n",
    "\n",
    "This differs from many treatments of Markov chains in that we are analyzing an \"absorbing chain\" (instead of a \"regular\" or \"ergodic\" one, see Kemeny, Snell, *Finite Markov Chains*, 2nd Edition, 1976, Springer Verlag), and we are using bespoke recurrence arguments instead of the usual move to linear algebra. In fact I would like to prove a standard result that I think many will find unlikely or surprising: conditioning on where this Markov chain eventually will stop greatly changes the observed transition probabilities, yet does preserve the Markov property of independence from the past.\n"

    "Pick an integer <code>k &gt; 0</code>. The states of our random process will be the integers <code>0</code> through <code>k</code>. The integers <code>0</code> and <code>k</code> are both \"stop conditions\" called \"stop zero\" and \"stop non-zero\". For an integer <code>i</code> strictly larger than <code>0</code> and strictly less than <code>k</code>, our random process is: pick the next integer to be either <code>i+1</code> (called moving up or moving right) or <code>i-1</code> (called moving down or moving left) with equal \"50/50\" probability. We stop the process when the state <code>i</code> is either <code>0</code> or <code>k</code>. This is called a \"random walk\" and is often known as \"the drunkard's walk\". Some variations have \"stay probabilities\" prior to stopping, but we will not need these here.\n",

    "The point of this note is to get some familiarity with deep facts about a specific random walk, before delegating to the usual general analysis tools.\n",

    "We have derived quite a few results for the \"half up, half down\" bounded drunkard's walk that stops at <code>0</code> or <code>k</code> (<code>k &gt; 0</code>):\n",
    "\n",
    "  * The probability of stopping at <code>k</code> after starting at <code>i</code> is <code>prob_pos<sub>k</sub>(i) = i/k</code>.\n",
    "  * The expected number of steps to stop after starting at <code>i</code> is <code>e_time<sub>k</sub>(i) = i * (k-i)</code>. In particular for a start state <code>i ~ k/2</code> this is  <code>k/2 * (k - k/2) = k<sup>2</sup> / 4</code> expected run time.\n",
    "  * The random process of looking only at sequences that stop at <code>0</code> is in fact itself a Markov chain.\n",
    "  * The random process of looking only at sequences that stop at <code>k</code> is in fact itself a Markov chain.\n",
    "  * If we condition on the walk stopping at <code>k</code>, then the probability of \"stepping up\" from state <code>i</code> (observing a <code>i</code> to <code>i+1</code> transition on a sequence that has not yet stopped) is <code>prob_up<sub>&rArr;,k</sub>(i) = (i+1)/(2*i)</code>.\n",
    "\n",
    "The above is a bit more detail than one usually tolerates in analyzing a Markov chain. Showing that conditioning on *where* the Markov chain stops preserves the Markov property is of interest. Also deriving the expected quadratic run time directly is quite nice.\n",

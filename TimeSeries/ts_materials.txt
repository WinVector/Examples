For this time series workshop no preparation is required. All results are from Python and R worksheets that we are sharing and I encourage you to run them yourself. With prior familiarity with Python or R the participant should be able to reproduce the example solutions, and then re-adapt the solutions to their own data.

This is a workshop, but given the 1 hour time structure I expect participants to run things after the workshop- not during or before. So no preparation is required, other than an interest in hearing about time series forecasting.

All of the slides, worksheets, and a rehearsal video are shared here: https://github.com/WinVector/Examples/blob/main/TimeSeries/README.md

Python packages used include:

  * cmdstanpy: control Stan from Python
  * numpy: numeric utilities
  * pandas: basic tables
  * plotine: ggplot2 style graphing
  * sklearn: machine learning utilities
  * statsmodels: statistical time series code

R packages used include:
  * dplyr: relational data manipulation
  * fable: time series package
  * forecast: time series package
  * ggplot2: graphing


The worksheets we are emphasizing in this workshop are (all in https://github.com/WinVector/Examples/blob/main/TimeSeries/ ):

Python:

  * Prophet_example.ipynb : (failed) Prophet solution attempt
  * Stan_soln.ipynb : the Stan solution (start of the workshop)
  * linear_model_bundle.ipynb : brute force machine learning solution
  * nested_model_example.ipynb : 
  * sm_example.ipynb : ARIMA solution

R:
  * ts_example.Rmd: ARIMA solution

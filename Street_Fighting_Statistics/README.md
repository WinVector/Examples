I am excited to share my guest lecture for Department of Statistics at the University of Illinois STAT 447: Data Science Programming Methods. And thank you to Dirk Eddelbuettel for inviting me!

The talk was titled "Data Science: Street Fighting Statistics" and demonstrates two simple supervised modeling tasks in R.

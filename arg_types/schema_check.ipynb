    "Notice the scary profusion of \"nearly compatible types\" such as `float` v.s. `numpy.float64` and `int` v.s. `numpy.int64`. What is going on is: to deal with mixed types Pandas must promote the column declarations to something that can contain both the original intended non-null values and the missingness indicators. For integers the column is promoted to floating point, as that allows a non-object column. The floating point promotion causes cell types to be changed from integer to floating point For more complicated cases the column must be promoted to object. The object promotion is used to allow both object cell types and heterogeneous cell types (such as `float` and `bool`). Without full knowledge of the cell values, the user can not anticipate the chosen conversions.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is frankly a bit hard to predict what types will be in a Pandas data frame given a set of values and operations. There are promotion rules such as mixtures of `int`s and `float`s become floats, and other mixtures become `object` columns. Though notice in object columns the extra freedom is used to preserve the distinction between `int`s and `float`s!\n",

    "  * No types we don't expect in those columns.\n",

    "These two covariant constraints are what we want to ensure we can write the operations over columns (which we need to know exist) and not get unexpected results (from unexpected types). The idea is: can we document and enforce (at least partial) schemas both on function signatures and data frames? This can be particularly useful for data science code near external data sources such as databases or CSV (comma separated value) files. Many of these sources themselves have data schemas and schema documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "I've started experimenting with a Python module to automate this task as debugging feature. As it is a debugging feature we want to be able to turn the feature on or off in an entire code base easily. To do this we define a indirect importer called [`schema_check.py`](https://github.com/WinVector/Examples/blob/main/arg_types/schema_check.py).  It's code looks like the following:\n",

Putting these lines in a shared import lets all other code switch behavior by only editing this file.\n",

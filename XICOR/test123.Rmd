Just for fun, what's the $\xi$ coefficient for $x = y = 1:N$?

```{r}

xi1toN = function(n) {
  x = 1:n
  y = 1:n
  xi = calculateXI(x, y)
}

N = 250

xi_n = vapply(2:N, xi1toN, numeric(1))

pframe = data.frame(n = 2:N, xi = xi_n)

ggplot(pframe, aes(x=n, y=xi)) + 
  geom_point() + geom_line() + 
  ggtitle('XI for x = y = 1:n')


```

From Equation 1.1 in the paper, the exact formula for $\xi(1...n, 1...n)$, $n$ > 1, is:

$$
1 - \frac{3}{n + 1}
$$

which goes to 1 as $n \to \infty$. The graph is pretty much consistent with my informal
eyeball estimate that one wants $n > 250$ to get a good estimate of the asymptotic value of $\xi$.

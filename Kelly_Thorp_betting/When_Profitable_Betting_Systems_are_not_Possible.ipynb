    "# When Profitable Betting Systems are not Possible\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this note I would like to demonstrate the impossibility of\n",
    "a profitable betting system for fair coin flip style games.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is in contrast to the case of card-dealing games, which\n",
    "can often have profitable betting systems. The most famous betting\n",
    "system is [Thorp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_O._Thorp)'s card counting strategies for [blackjack or 21](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackjack), in turn based on [Kelly's\n",
    "criterion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly_criterion). We demonstrate an\n",
    "example of a working card counting strategy (with code!) for the simple game of guessing whether the next\n",
    "card dealt is red or black can be found [here](https://win-vector.com/2021/02/25/kelly-thorp-betting/).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Betting Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "I find many non-mathematicians are completely unsatisfied with\n",
    "the claim that there cannot be a winning betting system for fair coin flip style games.\n",
    "They have a valid point; the result ([Doob's optional\n",
    "stopping theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optional_stopping_theorem)) is very close to the definitions. \n",
    "So the usual proof doesn't have a lot of\n",
    "content, and the audience usually doesn't have ready access to correct and concise\n",
    "statements of the appropriate probability definitions to start from.\n",
    "\n",
    "I would like to state some very simple *software engineering* definitions, that are sufficient\n",
    "to rigorously calculate the expected or average value of a betting system over a [martingale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martingale_(probability_theory)) (the proper name for the class of random processes that include what I\n",
    "have been calling \"fair coin flip\").\n",
    "We will then show that the expected change in stake is zero with\n",
    "respect to any implementable betting system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Proving that a betting system for cards exists is easy: it is enough\n",
    "to propose one and see it work, as we do [here](https://win-vector.com/2021/02/25/kelly-thorp-betting/). Proving a betting system\n",
    "for fair coin flips can not exist is in principle harder, as we\n",
    "are not saying only one system doesn't work- but asserting no system would.\n",
    "\n",
    "To appreciate this, the reader will have to accept two things.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Our clunky stand-in notation for probability theory captures\n",
    "    a little bit of the intuition of probabilities.\n",
    "  * That some things can be shown to be impossible. We are not using\n",
    "    the informal definition of impossible as \"very difficult\" which\n",
    "    allows phrases such as\n",
    "    Charles Alexandre de Calonne's \"Madame, si c'est possible, c'est fait;\n",
    "    impossible? cela se fera.\"\n",
    "    Or the WW2 US Army's \"The difficult we do immediately, the impossible takes a\n",
    "    little longer.\"\n",
    "    \n",
    "Luckily we don't really have to show anything is impossible. All we have to do \n",
    "is show the expected net-change in stake for any fair coin betting system is zero.\n",
    "That isn't to say there are not wild high-variance betting systems, it is just\n",
    "they all share the same expected change in stake: zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "So we are actually faced with a positive calculation."

    "We are going to work over a large table data structure for this entire\n",
    "note. This data structure is not powerful enough or graceful enough\n",
    "to represent all of the ideas of mathematical probability. However,\n",
    "it is just enough to precisely define our terms\n",
    "(including \"expected value\") and calculate that the expected value of\n",
    "betting in a martingale is zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Our event data table\n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to organize or betting situation and simulatons into\n",
    "$N$ rounds. For each round we generate:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * The last coin flip outcome \"$+1$\" (heads)\n",
    "    or \"$-1$\" (tails). Call this $C[t]$.\n",
    "  * A \"random number\" the betting algorithm can use, if desired, to \n",
    "    simulate randomized behavior. This is always an integer in the\n",
    "    range $0 \\cdots M$. Call this $U[t]$.\n",
    "    \n",
    "The entire trajectory or history of a possible play is stored\n",
    "in two vectors $(C, U)$. Where $C[t]$ is the $t$-th coin flip\n",
    "and $U[t]$ is the $t$-th bit of user randomness.\n",
    "There are exactly $2 M$ values for each round, so there are\n",
    "$2^N M^N$ possible distinct records $(C, U)$.\n",
    "We assume a notional table that has each possible record exactly once,\n",
    "hence holding $2^N M^N$ records.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are betting for exactly $N$ rounds. The game ends at time $N$, or\n",
    "earlier (betting zero is the same as not playing). All algorithms\n",
    "are going to be deterministic, aside from the random numbers we supply.\n",
    "With this crude finitist setup we avoid having to discuss many issues\n",
    "of measure theory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our gambling simulation works as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * A single record $(C, U)$ is drawn from our table, with each of the\n",
    "    $2^N M^N$ records being equally likely. This is the only\n",
    "    place we use probability in these arguments.\n",
    "  * We then simulate the gambling game by saying the\n",
    "    values $C_1, \\cdots, C_{t-1}$ and $U_1, \\cdots U_t$ are \"what is\n",
    "    seen at time $t$.\" Or, the record observable at time $t$ is\n",
    "    $(C[1:(t-1)], U[1:t])$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our entire appeal to the theory of distributions is: repeated plays\n",
    "of the game approach the expected value of summing over all rows\n",
    "in the above table. Thus, if we calculate the expected value\n",
    "of this table we have the expected value of repeated play.\n",
    "\n",
    "The trick of pretending all of the random\n",
    "selections have happened before we start is one of the most\n",
    "powerful in reasoning about probabilistic systems. It is perhaps\n",
    "most famous in its use in Doob's exposure martingale. The idea\n",
    "being: we pretend all random events are written down\n",
    "before we start, and we merely expose them in time order.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's realize an example of this data structure in `Python`. Some indexing will be from zero, not\n",
    "1 as Python and mathematics conventions differ.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's define an example record table with no user-random numbers $U$."

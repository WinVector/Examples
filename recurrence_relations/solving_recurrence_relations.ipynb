    "# Solving Recurrence Relations\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "A neat bit of \"engineering mathematics\" is solving [recurrence relations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrence_relation). The solution method falls out of the notation itself, and harkens back to a time where formal sums were often used in place of vector subscript notation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately the variety of such solutions is small enough to allow teaching by memorization. In this note I try to avoid memorization, and motivate the methodology. I feel this is facilitated by separating a number of often smeared together representations (formulas, sequences, vectors, linear checks, characteristic polynomial, and polynomial check families) into distinct realizations. We are also going to emphasize calculating and confirming claims in Python."

    "Our solution strategy was exchanging powerful subscripts (which can implement any integer keyed lookup table) with less powerful superscripts (that can only express powers). We can lift any solution found in the weaker world (power series) to the more general one (subscripted sequences). We don't always find enough power series solutions, and in that case we transform the problem to find more solutions to modified polynomials. The trick is to track the details of how the transforms operate on both our vector solutions and check polynomials.\n",

    "The above system is general, it can solve a lot of problems. We concentrated on calculating over vector values.

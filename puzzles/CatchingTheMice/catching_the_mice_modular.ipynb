The intuition is: `(12 - 1) % 11 = 0`, `(12 - 0) % 12 = 0`, and `(12 + 1) % 13 = 0`. Or in vector form `12 ~ (1, 0, -1)`.

    "The \"archeology\" of how could this have been solved at the time really appealed to us. To us the problem stank of number theory. Our first guess was some sort of [sieve method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes) crossing out non-solutions. This works and can quickly find the smallest solution. However, it seemed unlikely someone would run the Sieve up through 1000 to get the further claims in the answer. After seeing the claim of counting solutions (which is typically hard) we settled on methodologies that step through solutions, or even better step over groups of solutions.\n",

This felt similar to the solutions to [100 Bushels of Corn](https://ninazumel.com/blog/2024-09-26-100bushels/). It feels like the current writeup may be a shorter approach, as it uses the conditions on neighboring solutions to specify cases. John originally found the solution shift `12` from the CRT, and only later noticed that it is \"an obvious thing to consider.\"\n",

As `x%11 <= 9` we know that we have room to add more mass to `x%11`. We also know either `x%12 > 0` or `x%13 > 1`, so at least one of them has mass to spare without violating any of the basic check equations. However applying either move increases `x%11`, contradicting the supposed maximality. Therefore there are no solutions with `x%13 + x%12 + x%11 = 12`.\n"

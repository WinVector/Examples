    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's explore the statistics of cards drawn [without replacement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_random_sample) from a deck an equal number of black and red cards. What I want to characterize is how much card draws behave similarly to the simpler [binomial distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_distribution) behavior of coin flips.  We expect that the statistics of a small number of draws from a large deck look a lot like the statistics of independent coin flips. However, it is well known that [card counting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Card_counting) works for decks of cards, and not for dice/coins. So there are differences to characterize.\n",
    "\n",
    "A really fun example of how card draws differ from coin flips is the *risk-free* betting strategy for red versus black cards I outline in [\"Kelly Canâ€™t Fail\"](https://win-vector.com/2024/12/19/kelly-cant-fail/). This gives some of the thrill of [card-counting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Card_counting), without risk or the labor of learning the rules of [blackjack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackjack).\n",

This is the expected value of $X^k$ where the expectation is taken over independent repetitions of the entire experiment.  The first moment $\\text{E}[X]$ is also called the expected value, and in our case is equal to $n\\_trials / 2$.\n",

Let's use our rounding-level `10**(-k)` as an estimate of the probability of any two values colliding. Now there are `(c**m choose 2)` pairs. So for a randomized construction to have a good chance of finding a good encoding we would want `(c**m choose 2) 10**(-k) < 1`. There is no reason to insist on a simple randomized construction, but it is a useful heuristic to say things become plausible where such constructions work. Solve `(c**m choose 2) 10**(-k) < 1` for `m` by passing to the approximation `c**m c**m / 2 < 10**k` which gives us `m < (log(2) + k log(10)) / (2 log(c))`.\n",

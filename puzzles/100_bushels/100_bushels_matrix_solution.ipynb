In this case the methodology is to solve a [system of Diophantine equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diophantine_equation), or integer valued linear programming. Our challenge here is: can we demonstrate the methodology using code examples? In this note we give it a try.\n",

    "  1) Write down the problem as an integral matrix equation. From this we quickly observe the solutions lie in a one dimensional subspace.\n",
    "  2) Find a 1 to 1 onto (reversible) mapping from the standard integers to the integral solutions of the problem, ignoring the sign constraints. This portion is solved by finding a **_Smith normal form_** for the matrix equation (a Hermite normal form will do, but there are fewer steps to demonstrate using the Smith normal form).\n",

    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "[Béla Bollobás *The Art of Mathematics*, Cambridge 2006](https://www.amazon.com/Art-Mathematics-Coffee-Time-Memphis/dp/0521693950/) has as problem 156: \"Permutations of Vectors: Stienitz's Theorem.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "This theorem states:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Let <code>x<sub>1</sub></code>, ... <code>x<sub>n</sub></code> be vectors of norm at most <code>1</code> in a <code>d</code>-dimensional normed space such that <code>x<sub>1</sub> + ... + x<sub>n</sub> = 0</code>. Then there is a permutation <code>&#960; &#8712; S<sub>n</sub></code> such that <code>||x<sub>&#960;(1)</sub> + ... + x<sub>&#960;(k)</sub>|| &le; d</code> for every <code>k</code>.\n",
    "\n",
    "The content of this is: if a sum if small departures ends at the origin, then we can re-order the sum so *all* partial sums are in a small ball.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if we have <code>d=1</code>, <code>x<sub>1</sub>, ... x<sub>10</sub> = 1</code>, and <code>x<sub>11</sub>, ... x<sub>20</sub> = -1</code> we see <code>x<sub>1</sub> + ... + x<sub>10</sub> = 10</code> (which is big!), but the theorem states there is a re-ordering so that all the partial sums have norm no more than <code>1</code>.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note, Bollobás states original proof of the theorem only established the weaker result <code>&le; 2 d</code>, and many papers gave even worse bounds (many exponential in the dimension!). Bollobás' presentation is derived from [Grinberg, Victor & Sevastyanov, Sergey. (1980) \"Value of the Steinitz constant. Functional Analysis and Its Applications\" - FUNCT ANAL APPL-ENGL TR. 14. 125-126. 10.1007/BF01086559](ValueoftheSteinitzconstantFunctionalanalysisanditsapplications1421980125-126.pdf\n",
    "). My reading of the note is: the proof applies to all norms as long as the norm used to evaluate the vectors and the sum are the same norm. Essentially only scaling and the triangle inequality are central to the argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "## An Example\n",
    "\n",
    "In this note I'll give a very simple example where the sum has an asymptotic (or large <code>d</code>) growth rate of <code>sqrt(d / 5)</code> for the Euclidian norm. This shows there are vector sets where the sums must grow as a function of the dimension, no matter what the ordering. I.e., establishing there is in fact something to prove. Obviously this bound isn't tight, but it is picked for ease of calculation and explanation. Grinberg and Sevastyanov knock this example off in one line, but I feel it pays to slow down the exposition.\n",
    "\n",
    "For our example we will take <code>d</code> even and <code>n = 2 * d</code>. We will define our vectors <code>x<sub>i</sub></code> as follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "For <code>i = 1, ..., n/2</code> we define \"type a\" <code>x<sub>i, j</sub></code> as:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * <code>1</code> if <code>j = i</code>\n",
    "  * <code>0</code> otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "For <code>i = n/2 + 1, ..., n</code> we define \"type b\" <code>x<sub>i, j</sub></code> as:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * <code>-1 / d</code>.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is easy to check these are norm no more than <code>1</code> vectors that sum to zero. We will also confirm a larger intermediate sum under any permutation of the summation order.\n",
